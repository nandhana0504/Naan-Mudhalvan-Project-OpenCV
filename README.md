# Naan-Mudhalvan-Project-OpenCV


This repository contains OpenCV-based computer vision projects developed as part of the Naan Mudhalvan training program. Each project applies image processing and AI techniques to solve real-world problems in Currency Authentication, Virtial background replacement and Augmented Reality (AR) Marker Detection.


Project Overview

1. Currency Note Authentication 

Descripton : A Currency Note Authentication System verifies the authenticity of 
banknotes using image processing and machine learning to detect counterfeit 
notes.

Input : Image or Scanned Copy of a Currency Note

Output: Authenticity Result 

2.  Virtual Background Replacement

Description : A Virtual Background Replacement System detects and segments the 
foreground (usually a person) from a live video or image and replaces the 
background with a custom image or videoâ€”commonly used in video 
conferencing and media production.

Input : Live Video Feed or Static Image

Output : Processed Image or Video Stream 

3. Augmented Reality (AR) Marker Detection

Description : AR Marker Detection is a computer vision process that recognizes specific 
visual markers in a camera feed and uses them to anchor virtual 3D content in the 
real world. 

Input :  Live Camera Feed or Image

Output : Marker Detection 

REQUIREMENTS


1. Python 3.x


2.OpenCV (install opencv-python)


3.Numpy (pip install numpy)
